KUALA LUMPUR: The University of Malaya has clinched the 24th position in the QS University Rankings 2018: Asia - up four places from last year's 27, as announced by global higher education analysts QS Quacquarelli Symonds today.

In the latest edition of the QS rankings of universities in Asia, UM - Malaysia’s best university - achieves its highest-ever among the 425 universities from 17 Asian nations which were ranked by QS this year.

Its acting vice-chancellor Prof Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said, “A better rank will help the university to be better known, attract better collaborative partners, staff, and students and thus improve the quality of its graduates, research outputs, and contributions to the country.”

Prior to this result, UM has shown tremendous improvement in terms of world rankings.

Last month, the university made it to the top 400 of the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2018, a ranking of the top 1,000 universities from 77 countries.

The university, a new entrant in the THE list was ranked in the 351 - 400 band.

In June, UM remained Malaysia’s leading university in the QS World University Rankings 2018 by rising 19 places to the 114th position.
