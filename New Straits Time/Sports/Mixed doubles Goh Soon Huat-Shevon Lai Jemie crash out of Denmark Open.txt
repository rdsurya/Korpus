KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's interest at the Denmark Open came to an end on Saturday when mixed doubles Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai Jemie crashed out in the semi-finals in Odense.

Soon Huat-Shevon, playing in their maiden Super Series Premier last four, lost 21-16, 21-16 to top seeds Zheng Siwei-Chen Qingchen of China.

Despite the defeat, the Malaysian duo is still proud of their achievement, and they now have their sights on breaking into the world top 10 by the end of the year.

"We may have lost but we are not broken," said Shevon, who together with Soon Huat are currently ranked No 14 in the world.

"There is still much to be learned, but as a pair, we have grown so much since being paired late last year.

"This tournament has boosted our confidence and we know where we stand now in terms of our level of play.

"If we can keep this momentum going, we can definitely break into the world top 10 by the end of the year."

The Kuala Lumpur Sea Games (KL2017) silver medallists, will next travel to Paris for the French Open next week.

They open their campaign against South Korea's Seo Seung Jae-Kim Ha Na.
