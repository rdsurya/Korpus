JOHOR BARU: Malaysia collected their first point in the Sultan of Johor Cup following a 1-1 draw with Japan at the Taman Daya Hockey Stadium on Wednesday.

Akhimullah Anuar Esook gave Malaysia the lead by sneaking the ball past Japanese goalkeeper Yusuke Takano in the 17th minute.

However, Japan equalised through Takumi Ineyama’s penalty corner conversion past Malaysian custodian Zaimi Mat Deris in the 32nd minute.

Malaysia could have notched their first win had they were sharper in penalty corners.

In other matches, India took advantage of an inexperienced United States to register a 22-0 win, while Britain overcame Australia 4-2.

India, the reigning Junior World Cup champions, and Britain have earned nine points each but the former lead the standings on goal difference.

“We had no choice but to put in the goals as all teams are fighting for a top-two finish to qualify for the final,” said India coach Jude Felix Sebastian.

“I did not want to tire the players as we have an important game against Australia tomorrow. It was not our intention to win big but we just no choice.”

Britain coach Jon Bleby was pleased with his players’ performance yesterday.

“It is a sweet win as Australia are a good team. I am especially satisfied with our first half performance. We have two matches left and we need to prepare and work very hard for them,” said Bleby.

Australian coach Brent Livermore was disappointed with the defeat and blamed his players for not following instructions.

“Yes, I am very disappointed. We lacked discipline and urgency. We only played 50 per cent of our capacity,” said Livermore.
