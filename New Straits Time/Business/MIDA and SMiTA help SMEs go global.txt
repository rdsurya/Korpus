KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) together with the SME International Trade Association of Malaysia (SMiTA) organised the SMiTA Biz Connect Day at MIDA HQ on 25 October 2017.

The event which aims to encourage local SMEs to explore new market opportunities in Latin America namely Peru and Chile, was attended by about 100 participants.

In his welcome remarks, the Deputy Chief Executive of MIDA, Datuk N. Rajendran said, “As we intensify efforts to grow our domestic industry players, we are delighted to collaborate with SMiTA in facilitating SMEs to venture to Peru and Chile, and break new grounds.

“ With the increasing competition, it is timely for these companies that have been thriving in Malaysia over the years to spread their wings and tap into a bigger customer base as well as gaining access to new resources.”

“In going abroad, all parties – the business community and the government stand to benefit. It not only deepens the global presence of SMEs, but strengthens the Malaysia brand as well. Investments from these two Latin America companies have not been significant in Malaysia.

“However, with more Malaysian companies expanding their reach there, we trust that this will translate into a better understanding on the investment opportunities available in Malaysia by the business communities there,” he further added. - Bernama
