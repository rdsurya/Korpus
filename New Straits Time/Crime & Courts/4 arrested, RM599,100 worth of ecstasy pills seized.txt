JOHOR BARU: The Johor police yesterday seized 19,970 ecstasy pills worth RM599,100 from a house in Kempas in a follow-up operation after the arrest of four people believed to be members of a drug trafficking syndicate.

Deputy state police chief Datuk Kamarudin Md Din said the pills weighing 5.6 kg were seized after one of the suspects led the police team to the stash that was kept in a house in Taman Sinaran Kempas.

"About 2.45pm yesterday, a team from the state Criminal Investigation Department, state Narcotics Criminal Investigation Department and Johor Baru Utara police district took a 26-year-old male suspect to the house in Taman Sinaran Kempas.

"Police found 19,970 pills believed to be ectasy weighing 5.6kg from a room at the house.

"The pills were valued at RM599,100 and this makes the case one of our biggest drug busts so far this year.

"Initial investigations showed that the drugs were probably produced domestically," said Kamarudin, adding that the drugs were supposed to be sold at entertainment centres here.

The four suspects were caught red-handed packing drugs in a budget hotel room in Taman Setia Tropika in the early morning of Oct 20.

The three men, aged 26 and 39, and a 33-year-old woman were detained after police raided the room and seized 15 packets of ecstasy pills weighing 4.5kg and 5.08g of methamphetamine in the 1.50am operation.

Kamarudin said the four suspects were believed to have been operating their illicit activity for the past three months.
