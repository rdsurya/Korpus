MELAKA: A car wash worker claimed trial at the Sessions Court today to two counts of sexually assaulting a woman at a home in Bukit Katil here last month.

Abdul Rauf Singaravelu, 27, was charged with forcing Hau May Fang, 40, to perform oral sex on him against her will and outraging her modesty.

Both offences were alleged to have been committed at a home in Taman Bukit Melaka between 11.30pm and 1am on Sept 18.

Deputy public prosecutor Shazreen Nadia Saaban did not offer bail as there was a possibility of the accused intimidating the victim who was the main witness in the case.

Rauf who was unrepresented pleaded for a low bail on the ground that he had to support his family.

Judge Norma Ismail denied bail.

On Sept 28 Rauf was charged before Norma with having sexual connection by object with the same woman and causing hurt to her.

These two offences were allegedly committed at the same place and time.

The court then set bail at RM15,000 and fixed today for mention.

Today Norma fixed the four cases to be heard jointly on Feb 22 and 23.
