KAJANG: Police have arrested two suspected drug dealers in separate raids on Monday and seized cannabis worth RM1,200.

Kajang police chief Assistant Commissioner Dzaffir Mohd Yussof said in the first operation, a 26-year-old man was detained after he was found acting in a suspicious manner in Bandar Baru Bangi.

“We found 10 packets of drugs on the man’s body, believed to be cannabis, weighing about 80.7 gram,” he said, adding that the drugs were worth RM300.

The drugs, which were found hidden in cigarette boxes, were meant to be marketed to students in Kajang.

He said in a second operation three hours later, a team of policemen nabbed a 36-year-old man at a house in Cheras Perdana.

“The team found 17 packets of drugs believed to be cannabis weighing 348.6 gram and worth RM900.

“Both men have been remanded for five days until Oct 28 to facilitate investigations,” he said in a press conference today, adding that the suspects are both Malaysians.

Both men are being investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which carries the mandatory death penalty by hanging if convicted.

Dzaffir said the two men operated separately and did not know each other. The police, he added, are identifying the source of their drug supply.
